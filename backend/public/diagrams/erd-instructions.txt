PlantUML ERD Generation Instructions
=================================

The PlantUML code has been generated and saved as 'erd.puml' in the backend directory.

To generate the ERD diagram image, please use one of the following online PlantUML services:

1. PlantText: https://www.planttext.com/
2. PlantUML Online Server: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/

Instructions:
1. Copy the contents of the 'erd.puml' file
2. Paste it into the online editor of your chosen service
3. The diagram will be generated automatically
4. Download the generated image
5. Save it to the 'backend/public/diagrams' directory as 'erd.png'

Alternatively, if you want to use PlantUML locally:
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system
2. Download the PlantUML jar from https://plantuml.com/download
3. Run: java -jar plantuml.jar erd.puml

Note: The error you encountered was likely due to Java not being properly installed or configured.
The PlantUML library requires Java to generate diagrams.
